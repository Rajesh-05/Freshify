### Technologies used

Web Application: Develop a web application using **React** for tailoring the ripening of consumables according to the travel destination.

Ethylene Gas Monitoring: Utilize **ethylene gas monitoring** technology to optimize freshness during transit, extending the shelf life of fruits and vegetables.

Advanced Sensors: Incorporate **advanced sensors** for real-time monitoring of ethylene levels, temperature, and humidity, enabling precise control over the cargo's environment.

Active Ventilation System: Implement an **active ventilation system** to expel excess ethylene gas and maintain optimal preservation conditions, preventing spoilage and extending shelf life.

Data Analytics: **Analyze data** on ethylene levels, environmental factors, and other variables to make informed decisions about routes, storage conditions, and delivery schedules.

Machine Learning Model: Integrate a **regression model** with an accuracy of **85%** for predictive analysis and optimization of the ripening process.
